# Toward Speeding up Mutation Analysis by Memoizing Expensive Methods

This repository contains the log files produced by MeMu and PIT that we used in reporting the data in our paper.
For each subject program in Table I in the paper, there is a folder under the directory `logs`.
The subdirectories are suffixed with SHA-1 number denoting the commit id for the program that we checked out from GitHub.
Within each subdirectory (except JFreeChart upon which we didn't run MeMu) there are 2 files named `before`, `after`, respectively, and a folder named `pit-report`.
The files `before` and `after` are generated using MeMu with memoization disabled (i.e., plain [PITest](http://pitest.org/), without memoization optimization) and memoization activated, repectively.
These files contain timing information and the number of cache hits and misses.
The folder `pit-report` contains the files generated by PITest with all mutators activated; two kinds of reports are generated: HTML and XML.

Under the root directory, you can use the shell-script `print-table` to print out the table based on the log files.
